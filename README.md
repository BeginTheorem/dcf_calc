# Calendar discounted cash flows calculator
A simple Python script for calculating the internal rate of return (IRR) of a calendar cash flow. 
## Dependencies:
Python libraries `csv`, `datetim`, `numpy`.
## How to use:
1. Download both files `calculator.py` and `Транзакции.csv` to the same directory.
2. Write down your cash flow in the file `Транзакции.csv` as date-sum pairs separated by a space. Dates should be specified in the `dd.mm.yyyy` format. Investments are negative, profits are positive.
3. Launch the sript in terminal by
```sh
python3 ./calculator.py
```
or
```powershell
python ./calculator.py
```
4. It'll explain the rest itself.
